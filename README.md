Pr√°ctica 4 - Calculadora

## First version
Only basic operations are executed, without taking into account cases where errors may exist.

## Second version
I make some modifications to the structure and names of the functions. 
I modify html so that the result or error message shows up inline with the text "result =".
It is not specified but it is decided that the operands will be integers as it is a basic calculator.
